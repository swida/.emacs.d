# .emacs.d

My personal Emacs config.

It makes heavy use
of [`use-package`](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package), downloading
required packages from [elpa](https://elpa.gnu.org/)
and [melpa](https://melpa.org/). Even my own personal packages (which make
no sense being contributed to public package archives) live
in [a package archive](http://blog.davep.org/delpa/).

Forked from https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d
